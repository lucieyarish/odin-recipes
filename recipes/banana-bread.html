        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist 
        and sweet quick bread but some recipes are yeast raised (not this one though!).</p>
    <p>The original recipe can be viewed <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/banana_bread/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>  
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mix in 1/2 cup chopped nuts or dried fruit</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. 
                Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. 
                Mix in the flour.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350째F (175째C), 
                or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few 
                dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is 
                browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue 
                baking until the loaf is fully baked.</li>
        </ol>
